# MemoryGame


A classic card-matching memory game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players flip cards to find matching pairs, with smooth animations and win detection logic. Designed with a clean UI and responsive grid layout. This project highlights DOM interaction, state management, and user-focused interface feedback.
